**An Open-Source AI-Powered Calendar for the Future of Scheduling**

## What is Zero Calendar?
Zero Calendar is an open-source AI calendar solution that gives users the power to manage their schedule intelligently while integrating with external services like Google Calendar and other calendar providers. Our goal is to modernize and improve scheduling through AI agents to truly revolutionize how we manage our time.

## Why Zero Calendar?
Most calendar services today are either closed-source, data-hungry, or lack intelligent features. Zero Calendar is different:

✅ **Open-Source** – No hidden agendas, fully transparent.  
🦾 **AI Driven** - Enhance your scheduling with AI assistants & LLMs.  
🔒 **Data Privacy First** – Your schedule, your data. Zero Calendar does not track, collect, or sell your data in any way.  
⚙️ **Self-Hosting Freedom** – Run your own calendar app with ease.  
📅 **Unified Calendar** – Connect multiple calendar providers like Google Calendar, Outlook, and more.  
🎨 **Customizable UI & Features** – Tailor your calendar experience the way you want it.  
🚀 **Developer-Friendly** – Built with extensibility and integrations in mind.  

## Tech Stack
Zero Calendar is built with modern and reliable technologies:

- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes, Server Actions
- **Database**: Vercel KV (Redis)
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js, Google OAuth
